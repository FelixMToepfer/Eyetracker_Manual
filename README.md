# Eyetracker_Manual
The files in this repository are created to make the EyeLink 1000+ easily accessible to beginners.
It relays on the manuals provided by Eyelink, the introduction by an Eyelink salesman and personal experience.

Example scripts and data analysis pipelines are gathered from open accessible code from:
